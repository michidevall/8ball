Magic 8 Ball


Magic 8 ball was a toy in the eighties that was suppose to tell your fortune. This is a page that makes that game digital. You type in your question and it will tell you the fortune of that question. It has a question bar to enter your question and an alert in case the question bar is left blank. It also has a click function for the ball to give the answer to the question when the ball is clicked. It also has an element to randomize the answers to the questions so it's not the same answer ever time. The answer will stay on the ball until the page is refreshed or a new question is asked. If the answer bar is blank, the ball will display the number 8. The text for the answers are in blue to resemble the actual magic 8 ball. I also did a gradient on page and chose the text to give it a little styling.
